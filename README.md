### Spampede - Custom Snake Game

This repository contains all the files for my *Spampede Game*. 
It contains a user interface and backend functionality that is similar to the "Snake Game," but it contains my own twist. 

The user will have to *eat spam to elongate*, and the game will be ONLY over if the user hits a wall, itself, or runs out of space.

There is also an **AI-Mode** where it features an automated, optimal gameplay setting by the AI. The AI will continue to play the game until there are no possible paths to traverse to from its current location.

Spampede utilizes a *Java Applet* application to run the game! Run the game on the SpampedeBrain.java file!

In order to play, all files must be downloaded and opened on an IDE (preferably Eclipse).
**Controls**: i - up, j - left, k- down, l - right, r - reverse, a - AI Mode
Try it out and have fun!
