# Spampede: Custom-Snake-Game

### This repository contains all the files for my Spampede Game. 
### It contains a user interface and backend functionality that is similar to that of the "Snake Game" but it has my own twist. 

### The user will have to eat spam to elongate, and the game will be over if the user hits a wall, itself, or runs out of space.

### There is also an "AI-Mode" where it features an automated, optimal gameplay by the AI. It will continue to play the game until there 
### are no possible paths to traverse to from its current location.

### Controls: i - up, j - left, k- down, l - right, r - reverse, a - AI Mode
### Try it out and have fun!
